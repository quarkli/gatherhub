        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
		<h3>What is Gatherhub?</h3>
		<p>Gatherhub is a free and open space offering people to collaborate over the Internet. One can set up a hub and invite people to join to exchange information and ideas in public or private. Gatherhub provides features like hand-writing whiteboard, screen-casting, text message, audio/video conference and it is free and open to everyone.</p>
		<br>
		<h3><a name="wihap" style="text-decoration: none; color: black;">What is HUB and PEER?</a></h3>
		<p>A PEER represents a device used by the user to connect to a HUB. Each peer will be assigned a dynamic ID when it is connected to a hub. The peer ID is used as the source and destination of data transmission which is different from user's identity which is used as the recognition by the other users. A peer can only communicate with other peers who are in the same hub.</p>
		<p>A hub is a group identity constructed by a serial of characters. User may select their own preferred string as their hub ID or takes the ID generated by the system based on the computational composition result from user's identity which is usually not duplicated. Hub ID is open and not privately owned property. It is similar to a radio frequency that any one can listen from and speak to when they switch to a specific frequency. In radio communication, user may encode their data based on agreed code to make a private communication over public channel. Similarly, peers may share and apply an private code to ensure the privacy. When a peer sets an private code, its data will only be exchanged with peers who sets the same private code.</p>
		<p> A default public hub ID 1000 will be assigned to a peer if it connected without providing a hub ID. Peers with the same hub ID can send a broadcast messages to everyone in the hub or unicast messages to specific peer. User may send private code to specific peers via unicast to start a private hub mode.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>How many peers can be joined to a hub?</h3>
		<p>At the moment, we are still running performance validation test. There is not a limitation being set for now, but we might add some limitation to ensure the service availability.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Who is the onwer of a hub?</h3>
		<p>There is no owner of a hub.  Please refer to <a href="#wihap">What is HUB and PEER?</a></p>
		<br>
		<h3>Does Gatherhub need any plug-in such as Adobe Flash?</h3>
		<p>Gatherhub is mostly based on HTML5 standards and open source frameworks. There is no plug-in required, however, for screen-casting, user needs to install a Chrome Extension which turns user's screen content into a video streaming source.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Which browser is supported?</h3>
		<p>We recommend Google Chrome for PC, MAC, and Mobiles which is the most HTML5 compatible browser at the moment. Gatherhub has been tested workable on Google Chrom for computers and mobile devices. Gatherhub might work in other browsers without gaurantee.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Is communication secure over Gatherhub?</h3>
		<p>Gatherhub is running on SSL secure channel and communication between peers are also going through SSL channels. However, user should still be careful of transmitting sensitive information on Gatherhub, pleaser refer to our <a href="disclaimer.html">Term of Use / Disclaimer</a></p>
